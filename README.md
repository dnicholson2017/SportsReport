# Web Development Final Project - SportsReport

Submitted by: D'Andre Nicholson

SportReport is a web application where users sign-up and login to access content from the National Basketball Association (NBA). SportsReport will provide users with access to past match results, team profiles, player information, and live scores from the NBA. The application will utilize APIs to gather data and will incorporate features such as navigation through teams, players, and game pages, viewing team history, and displaying match highlights from YouTube.
